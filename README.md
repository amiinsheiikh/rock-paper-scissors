# rock-paper-scissors
A simple game of rock paper scissors was implemented using Python code.

We start by implementing a list of rock, paper, scissors.
In a while loop, we ask for user input and set the base case where if the input is Q/q we quit the game. 

Case 1: if the user and computer pick the same: it's a tie.

Case 2: if the user picks rock and the computer picks scissors: the user wins.

Case 3: if the user picks scissors and the computer picks paper: the user wins.

Case 4: if the user picks paper and the computer picks rock: the user wins.

In all other cases, the computer wins.

Once we receive an input of Q/q to quit.
We print scores for the user and computer. 

End of the game.
